# cachified-rs

A work-in-progress port of the [cachified](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/cachified) library by [Kent C. Dodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds) from TypeScript to Rust.

> Note: This library is still under development and production use is therefore not recommended (though I won't stop you if you want to try it out).

## Motivation

I loved the simplicity and functionality of the original `cachified` library, but I wanted to use it in a Rust project. Since there was no direct Rust equivalent, I decided to port it myself.

My goal was to create a similar API and functionality, though I took some creative liberties where I saw fit.

Also, I'm by no means a Rust expert, so contributions and feedback are welcome!
